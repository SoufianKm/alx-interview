# Minimum Operations Project

## Overview

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations.

## Concepts Needed

### Dynamic Programming

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

- Understand and apply dynamic programming techniques to break down and solve complex problems.
- Perform prime factorization to reduce the problem to its essential components.
- Optimize your code to ensure it runs efficiently.

## Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Break down the problem into subproblems and build up the solution using memoization or tabulation.
2. **Prime Factorization**: Decompose the target number `n` into its prime factors and use this decomposition to minimize operations.
3. **Code Optimization**: Analyze your code for performance bottlenecks and optimize it to improve efficiency.
4. **Greedy Algorithms**: Implement a greedy approach to iteratively select the optimal operation at each step.
5. **Python Implementation**: Write the solution using Python, leveraging functions, loops, and conditionals.
