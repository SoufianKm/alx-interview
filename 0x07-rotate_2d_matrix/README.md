# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This task requires a solid understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Key Concepts

### Matrix Representation in Python

- **2D Matrices as Lists of Lists**: In Python, a 2D matrix can be represented as a list of lists. Each inner list represents a row in the matrix.
- **Accessing and Modifying Elements**: Learn how to access and modify elements in a 2D matrix using indices.

### In-Place Operations

- **In-Place Modifications**: The task must be performed without creating a copy of the matrix. This minimizes space complexity by modifying the original matrix directly.

### Matrix Transposition

- **Transposing a Matrix**: This involves swapping the rows and columns of the matrix. Transposition is a key step in rotating the matrix.

### Reversing Rows in a Matrix

- **Row Reversal**: After transposing the matrix, each row needs to be reversed to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Nested Loops

- **Iterating Through a Matrix**: Use nested loops to iterate through the elements of the matrix and modify them as needed to perform the rotation.

## Approach

To successfully rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**: Swap the rows and columns of the matrix.
2. **Reverse Each Row**: Reverse the order of elements in each row to complete the rotation.

This project challenges you to think critically about in-place modifications, matrix operations, and optimizing your code's space complexity. Mastering these skills will enhance your problem-solving and algorithmic thinking abilities in Python.
