# UTF-8 Validation Project

Welcome to the UTF-8 Validation Project! This project aims to help you understand and validate UTF-8 encoded data by applying various concepts such as bitwise operations, UTF-8 encoding scheme, data representation, list manipulation, and boolean logic. Below are the concepts needed and the resources that will guide you through this project.

## Concepts Needed

### Bitwise Operations in Python

Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python is crucial for validating UTF-8 encoded data. Key operations include:

- AND (&)
- OR (|)
- XOR (^)
- NOT (~)
- Shifts (<<, >>)

**Resources**:
- [Python Bitwise Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-python/)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme

Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules is essential. This includes knowing how characters are encoded into one or more bytes and understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.

**Resources**:
- [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)

### Data Representation

Learn how to represent and work with data at the byte level, and handle the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### List Manipulation in Python

Be proficient in iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

**Resources**:
- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### Boolean Logic

Apply logical operations to make decisions within the program.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. **Understand and apply bitwise operations** to manipulate bits for UTF-8 validation.
2. **Recognize valid UTF-8 encoding patterns** and validate UTF-8 encoded characters.
3. **Represent and manipulate data at the byte level**, handling LSB of integers effectively.
4. **Iterate through and manipulate lists in Python** to process byte data.
5. **Apply boolean logic** to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Review the resources** provided to build a strong understanding of the necessary concepts.
2. **Write Python code** to validate UTF-8 encoded data by implementing bitwise operations, data representation techniques, and list manipulation methods.
3. **Test your code** with various UTF-8 encoded data samples to ensure its correctness.

### Example Code Snippet

Here is an example snippet to help you get started with bitwise operations in Python:

```python
def validate_utf8(data):
    num_bytes = 0

    for byte in data:
        if num_bytes == 0:
            if (byte >> 5) == 0b110:
                num_bytes = 1
            elif (byte >> 4) == 0b1110:
                num_bytes = 2
            elif (byte >> 3) == 0b11110:
                num_bytes = 3
            elif (byte >> 7) != 0:
                return False
        else:
            if (byte >> 6) != 0b10:
                return False
            num_bytes -= 1

    return num_bytes == 0

# Example usage:
data = [197, 130, 1]
print(validate_utf8(data))  # Output: True
```
