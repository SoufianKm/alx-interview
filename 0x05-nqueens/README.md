# N Queens

The "0x05. N Queens" project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, renowned for its application of the backtracking algorithm. The goal of this project is to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This README provides an overview of the concepts needed to understand and implement a solution to the N Queens problem using Python.

## Concepts Needed

### Backtracking Algorithms
Backtracking is a key technique used to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a partial solution cannot lead to a valid complete solution. This project leverages backtracking to efficiently find all possible configurations of N queens on the chessboard where no two queens threaten each other.

- **Backtracking Introduction**: Understand the theory and application of backtracking algorithms in problem-solving.

### Recursion
Recursion is a powerful tool in programming where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. This project heavily relies on recursion to implement the backtracking algorithm.

- **Recursion in Python**: Learn how to write recursive functions and understand the base and recursive cases.

### List Manipulations in Python
To keep track of the queens' positions on the board, you will need to create and manipulate lists. Understanding how to work with lists in Python is crucial for managing the state of the board during the solution process.

- **Python Lists**: Explore various list operations, such as adding, removing, and accessing elements, which are essential for implementing the solution.

### Python Command Line Arguments
Handling command-line arguments is an important skill, especially for testing and running your program with different inputs. You will use the `sys` module in Python to manage these arguments.

- **Command Line Arguments in Python**: Learn how to parse and use command-line arguments in your Python scripts.

## Project Goals
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N Queens problem using Python. This project is n
