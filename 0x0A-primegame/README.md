# Prime Game Project

## Overview

The Prime Game project is a competitive game scenario that challenges players to strategically remove prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The objective is to determine the winner based on the game's rules, requiring a deep understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization.

## Key Concepts

### Prime Numbers
- **Understanding Prime Numbers:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- **Efficient Identification:** Implement algorithms to efficiently identify prime numbers within a given range.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Efficient Prime Finding:** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit, which is particularly useful in this project.

### Game Theory
- **Basic Principles:** Players take turns in a competitive game, with the goal of making optimal moves to win.
- **Winning Strategies:** Understand the conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

### Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- **Optimizing Solutions:** Use dynamic programming or memoization to optimize the solution by reusing previous results for faster calculations in multiple rounds of the game.

### Python Programming
- **Implementation:** Use Python loops, conditional statements, arrays, and lists to implement the game logic and track the state of the game.
