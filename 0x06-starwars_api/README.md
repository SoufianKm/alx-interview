# Star Wars API Project

The "0. Star Wars Characters" project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with several key concepts related to web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Concepts Needed

### HTTP Requests in JavaScript
Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using the request module or alternatives like fetch in Node.js.
- [A Complete Guide to Making HTTP Requests in Node.js](#)

### Working with APIs
Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.
- Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.
- [Working with APIs in JavaScript](#)

### Asynchronous Programming
Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
- Handling API response data asynchronously.

## Project Overview
By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and resources, you will be able to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API. This project demonstrates your ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Make HTTP Requests**: Use Node.js to make HTTP requests to the Star Wars API.
2. **Work with APIs**: Understand how to interact with RESTful APIs and parse JSON responses.
3. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**: Use callbacks, promises, or async/await to manage asynchronous code.
4. **Command Line Arguments**: Access and use command-line arguments to get the movie ID.
5. **Manipulate and Iterate Arrays**: Iterate over the character data to display names.

By following these steps and leveraging the provided resources, you will complete the project and gain practical experience with web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
