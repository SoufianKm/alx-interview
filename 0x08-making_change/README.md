## Making Change

### Overview

The "Making Change" project addresses a classic problem in the field of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The primary objective is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to achieve a given total amount using a specified list of coin denominations. This project requires a deep understanding of algorithms to develop a solution that is both correct and efficient.

### Key Concepts

- **Greedy Algorithms:**
  - Learn how greedy algorithms function and why they are often used for the coin change problem.
  - Understand the limitations of greedy algorithms and recognize scenarios where they might not yield the optimal solution.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - Grasp the fundamentals of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
  - Explore the concepts of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure within the context of the coin change problem.

- **Algorithmic Complexity:**
  - Analyze the time and space complexity of different algorithms.
  - Aim to develop solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime requirements.

- **Problem-Solving Strategies:**
  - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
  - Compare iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

- **Python Programming:**
  - Manipulate lists and leverage list comprehensions.
  - Implement functions using efficient loops and conditional statements.
