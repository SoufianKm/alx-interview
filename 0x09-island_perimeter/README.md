# Island Perimeter

## Overview

The "Island Perimeter" project is designed to help you apply and reinforce your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and conditional logic within the context of solving a geometric problem using a 2D grid. In this project, you will calculate the perimeter of a single island represented by `1`s in a grid where the water is represented by `0`s. The grid is a 2D array (or matrix), and your goal is to determine the total length of the island's perimeter.

## Concepts Needed

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and Iterating Over Elements**: Understanding how to navigate through a 2D array, row by row and column by column.
- **Navigating Adjacent Cells**: Knowing how to check cells that are adjacent horizontally and vertically (up, down, left, right).

### Conditional Logic
- **Edge Contribution to Perimeter**: Identifying when a cell contributes to the perimeter based on its surroundings (e.g., checking if a neighboring cell is water or outside the grid).

### Counting Techniques
- **Calculating Perimeter**: Developing a systematic approach to count the edges of each land cell (`1`) that contribute to the island's perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Decomposition**: Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable tasks, such as identifying land cells and then calculating their perimeter contributions.
- **Iterative Approach**: Using loops to systematically check and count perimeter edges for each land cell in the grid.

### Python Programming
- **Nested Loops**: Utilizing nested loops to iterate over the grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements**: Applying logic to check the status of adjacent cells and update the perimeter count accordingly.
